# My first blog post

Alright, I finally got off my ass to make a blog. I wanted to do this for a few reasons:

- I've always found it easier to communicate my thoughts in writing
- I needed a space to organize my thoughts and share them with other people (as opposed to just writing them in my personal journal or keeping them locked up in my head)
- I'm bored, so why not?

So I looked into VuePress and found that it was actually pretty easy to get this thing working. I could have built my own blog, but to be honest I don't code much outside of work so I'm just going to roll with this. Basically, all I have to do is create a markdown file for each post and it'll render it directly into a customizable html template. Pretty neat!

Anyways, this blog will primarily be about:

- Hiking/backpacking/mountaineering adventures that I find notable, plus pictures where relevant
- Any articles related to weightlifting, running, or exercise training
- Musings about topics I find interesting, e.g. related to technology, society, philosophy, or how to make sense of this chaotic world
