<p>Alright, I finally got off my ass to make a blog. I wanted to do this for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've always found it easier to communicate my thoughts in writing</li>
<li>I needed a space to organize my thoughts and share them with other people (as opposed to just writing them in my personal journal or keeping them locked up in my head)</li>
<li>I'm bored, so why not?</li>
</ul>
<p>So I looked into VuePress and found that it was actually pretty easy to get this thing working. I could have built my own blog, but to be honest I don't code much outside of work so I'm just going to roll with this. Basically, all I have to do is create a markdown file for each post and it'll render it directly into a customizable html template. Pretty neat!</p>
<p>Anyways, this blog will primarily be about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiking/backpacking/mountaineering adventures that I find notable, plus pictures where relevant</li>
<li>Any articles related to weightlifting, running, or exercise training</li>
<li>Musings about topics I find interesting, e.g. related to technology, society, philosophy, or how to make sense of this chaotic world</li>
</ul>
