# About Me

I'm a Bay Area native and a graduating statistics major from UC Berkeley, interested in everything from machine learning to writing SQL queries. In my free time, I'm either lifting weights, running up mountains, or baking pastries. I also once had 2 [Challenger](https://lolchess.gg/profile/na/zyonsis) [accounts](https://lolchess.gg/profile/na/zyonsis2) (top .01%) in a game called [Teamfight Tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teamfight_Tactics), in case anyone cares.
